## Overview

Randomized atractive Color Palette's generator.  

- Can be limited by Hue and luminance ranges.  
- Colors can be sorted by hue, saturation and brightness.

## Ported from javascript based Random Color 
Original Demo [here](https://randomcolor.lllllllllllllllll.com/).

## Why does this exist?
_There are lots of clever one-liners for generating random colors:  
Unfortunately, this code naturally produces murky greys, browns and greens.  
randomColor generates attractive colors by default.  
More specifically, randomColor produces bright colors with a reasonably high saturation. This makes randomColor particularly useful for data visualizations and generative art._

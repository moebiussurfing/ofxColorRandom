### Why does this exist?
_There are lots of clever one-liners for generating random colors:
Unfortunately, this code naturally produces murky greys, browns and greens.
randomColor generates attractive colors by default. More specifically, randomColor produces bright colors with a reasonably high saturation. This makes randomColor particularly useful for data visualizations and generative art._
